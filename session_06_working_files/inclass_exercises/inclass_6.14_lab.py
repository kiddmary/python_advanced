# 6.14:  Create a class Name that allows you to store a person's first and last name:

import runreport

n = Name('David', 'Blaikie')

print(n.first)      # 'David'
print(n.last)       # 'Blaikie'

# The class only needs to define an __init__() method, which besides 'self' must accept the 2
# additional arguments (first name and last name).
# 
# In __init__(), store the two values in attributes .first and .last.
# 
# Use the above code as a test to see that the attributes have been successfully stored.
